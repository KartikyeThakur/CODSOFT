# CODSOFT
A fully functional calculator app built using Kivy to perform functionality calculator. This project demonstrates the use of Kivy for building graphical user interface (GUI) applications in Python, offering a clean and responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile platforms.


## Project Title

**Kivy Calculator App**

## Description

The Kivy Calculator App is designed of calculator, providing a familiar and user-friendly interface. It supports basic arithmetic operations, special functions like percentage calculation, and toggling the sign of numbers. The app is built using Kivy, an open-source Python library for developing multitouch applications. This project serves as a practical example of how to create visually appealing and functional GUI applications using Kivy.

Key features of the Kivy Calculator App include:
- Intuitive user interface inspired by the iOS calculator.
- Real-time calculation and immediate feedback on button presses.
- Error handling to manage invalid inputs and operations.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

## API Reference

This project does not utilize any external APIs. All functionalities are implemented within the Kivy framework.

## Color Reference

The colors used in the Kivy Calculator App are chosen to closely resemble the iOS calculator:

- **Background Color:** Black (RGB: 0, 0, 0)
- **Button Colors:**
  - Dark Gray (RGB: 77, 77, 77)
  - Light Gray (RGB: 153, 153, 153)
  - Orange (RGB: 255, 153, 0)
  - White (RGB: 255, 255, 255)

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Special Operations:**
  - **Clear (AC):** Resets the calculator to its initial state.
  - **Toggle Sign (+/-):** Changes the sign of the current input.
  - **Percentage (%):** Calculates the percentage of the current input.
- **Real-time Calculation:** Immediate display of results as calculations are performed.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Environment Variables

This project does not require any environment variables for its operation.

## Installation

To run the Kivy Calculator App locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KartikyeThakur/CODSOFT.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd kivy-calculator-app
   ```
3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install kivy
   ```

## Lessons Learned

- **GUI Development:** Enhanced understanding of developing GUI applications using the Kivy framework.
- **User Interface Design:** Gained insights into designing responsive and intuitive user interfaces.
- **Event Handling:** Learned how to manage user interactions and perform real-time calculations.
- **Error Management:** Developed strategies for handling invalid inputs and errors gracefully.

## Optimizations

Future enhancements for the Kivy Calculator App could include:
- **Advanced Functions:** Adding support for more complex mathematical functions (e.g., trigonometry, logarithms).
- **Customization:** Allowing users to choose from different themes or customize the appearance of the calculator.
- **Animation:** Adding subtle animations to improve the user experience.
- **Localization:** Providing support for multiple languages to reach a wider audience.

## Run Locally

To run the Kivy Calculator App locally, follow the installation steps and then execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Running Tests

This project does not currently include automated tests. Manual testing has been conducted to ensure functionality and correctness of the app.

## Usage/Examples

After running the application, you can perform basic arithmetic operations using the on-screen buttons. The calculator behaves similarly to a typical handheld calculator, providing immediate feedback and accurate results.

Example usage:
- **Addition:** Press `2`, then `+`, then `3`, and finally `=` to see the result `5`.
- **Subtraction:** Press `9`, then `-`, then `4`, and finally `=` to see the result `5`.
- **Multiplication:** Press `6`, then `ร`, then `7`, and finally `=` to see the result `42`.
- **Division:** Press `8`, then `รท`, then `2`, and finally `=` to see the result `4`.
- **Percentage:** Press `50`, then `%` to see the result `0.5`.
